# ODSTVisualRandomizer
An easy-to-use randomizer for Halo 3: ODST on the Master Chief Collection (MCC).



# Requirements
- Halo 3: ODST on MCC
- Halo 3: ODST official mod tools (aka H3ODSTEK)
  - They can be downloaded via Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695794/Halo_3_ODST_Mod_Tools__MCC/
 
# How to use
1. Consider backing up your installation of Halo 3: ODST as the tool will overwrite it.
2. If you use the mod tools for other purposes, consider backing up any files you've edited as the tool will overwrite them
3. Start ODSTVisualRandomizer.exe
4. Configure your seed and other settings as you please (default settings recommended)
5. Make sure the MCC path and H3ODSTEK path matches what is on your computer.
     - You can check the path of each from your steam library by: right clicking -> manage -> browse local files
     - If you have your MCC installation across multiple locations, make sure it is the one where Halo 3: ODST is installed.
6. Click start randomization. The first level takes 10+ minutes to finish randomizing. All levels finish randomizing in about 60 minutes.
7. Play! Make sure you boot MCC with anti-cheat off. You can play levels that have already been randomized while you wait for the remaining levels to randomize.

# FAQ
- What does this randomize?
  - Character types, the weapons held, if characters are in vehicles (no vehicle to vehicle only), the types of vehicles they use, weapons, vehicles, equipment and weapon crates, custscene dialogue, and cutscene model variants. Certain enemies that if randomized could softlock the game are not randomized. Flood infection forms are not randomized into to avoid glitches, but can still be spawned by flood tank forms and flood carrier forms.
- How likely is a softlock?
  - Pretty unlikely. You should expect to go through the game with no major issues. Once in a blue moon, an enemy you need to kill will be stuck in level geometry. If you get stuck, try looking around for enemies on rooftops or backtracking and going back through a level without using a flying vehicle.
- Can I play this online with friends?
  - Unlike the other randomizer I've made for Halo, online will not consistently work. A later version will likely have this fixed.
- Why does the randomizer take so long?
  - It builds and compiles each level from scratch using the offiical mod tools. This ensures that all objects are loaded into each level and made it drasticlly easier for me to code.
- Will you make randomizers for the other Halo games?
  - I already have one for Halo 3 and Reach. I might make a randomzier for 4 as that is also compatible with this method of randomization. Do not expect ones for Halo CE or 2.

 Huge thanks to Daniel McCluskey for laying the groundwork for this tool.
